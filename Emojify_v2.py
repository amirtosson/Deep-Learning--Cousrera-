# # Emojify! 
# 
# Welcome to the second assignment of Week 2. You are going to use word vector representations to build an Emojifier. 
# 
# Have you ever wanted to make your text messages more expressive? Your emojifier app will help you do that. So rather than writing "Congratulations on the promotion! Lets get coffee and talk. Love you!" the emojifier can automatically turn this into "Congratulations on the promotion! üëç Lets get coffee and talk. ‚òïÔ∏è Love you! ‚ù§Ô∏è"
# 
# You will implement a model which inputs a sentence (such as "Let's go see the baseball game tonight!") and finds the most appropriate emoji to be used with this sentence (‚öæÔ∏è). In many emoji interfaces, you need to remember that ‚ù§Ô∏è is the "heart" symbol rather than the "love" symbol. But using word vectors, you'll see that even if your training set explicitly relates only a few words to a particular emoji, your algorithm will be able to generalize and associate words in the test set to the same emoji even if those words don't even appear in the training set. This allows you to build an accurate classifier mapping from sentences to emojis, even using a small training set. 
# 
# In this exercise, you'll start with a baseline model (Emojifier-V1) using word embeddings, then build a more sophisticated model (Emojifier-V2) that further incorporates an LSTM.

# ## 1 - Baseline model: Emojifier-V1
# 
# ### 1.1 - Dataset EMOJISET
# 
# Let's start by building a simple baseline classifier. 
# 
# You have a tiny dataset (X, Y) where:
# - X contains 127 sentences (strings)
# - Y contains a integer label between 0 and 4 corresponding to an emoji for each sentence
# 
# <img src="images/data_set.png" style="width:700px;height:300px;">
# <caption><center> **Figure 1**: EMOJISET - a classification problem with 5 classes. A few examples of sentences are given here. </center></caption>
# 
# Let's load the dataset using the code below. We split the dataset between training (127 examples) and testing (56 examples).


X_train, Y_train = read_csv('data/train_emoji.csv')
X_test, Y_test = read_csv('data/tesss.csv')


maxLen = len(max(X_train, key=len).split())




index = 1
print(X_train[index], label_to_emoji(Y_train[index]))


# ### 1.2 - Overview of the Emojifier-V1
# 
# In this part, you are going to implement a baseline model called "Emojifier-v1".  

# The input of the model is a string corresponding to a sentence (e.g. "I love you). In the code, the output will be a probability vector of shape (1,5), that you then pass in an argmax layer to extract the index of the most likely emoji output.

# To get our labels into a format suitable for training a softmax classifier, lets convert $Y$ from its current shape  current shape $(m, 1)$ into a "one-hot representation" $(m, 5)$, where each row is a one-hot vector giving the label of one example, You can do so using this next code snipper. Here, `Y_oh` stands for "Y-one-hot" in the variable names `Y_oh_train` and `Y_oh_test`: 


Y_oh_train = convert_to_one_hot(Y_train, C = 5)
Y_oh_test = convert_to_one_hot(Y_test, C = 5)


# Let's see what `convert_to_one_hot()` did. Feel free to change `index` to print out different values. 



index = 50
print(Y_train[index], "is converted into one hot", Y_oh_train[index])



word_to_index, index_to_word, word_to_vec_map = read_glove_vecs('data/glove.6B.50d.txt')



word = "cucumber"
index = 289846
print("the index of", word, "in the vocabulary is", word_to_index[word])
print("the", str(index) + "th word in the vocabulary is", index_to_word[index])


# **Exercise**: Implement `sentence_to_avg()`. You will need to carry out two steps:
# 1. Convert every sentence to lower-case, then split the sentence into a list of words. `X.lower()` and `X.split()` might be useful. 
# 2. For each word in the sentence, access its GloVe representation. Then, average all these values.

# #### Model
# 
# You now have all the pieces to finish implementing the `model()` function. After using `sentence_to_avg()` you need to pass the average through forward propagation, compute the cost, and then backpropagate to update the softmax's parameters. 
# 
# **Exercise**: Implement the `model()` function described in Figure (2). Assuming here that $Yoh$ ("Y one hot") is the one-hot encoding of the output labels
# We provided you a function `softmax()`.

# **What you should remember from this part**:
# - Even with a 127 training examples, you can get a reasonably good model for Emojifying. This is due to the generalization power word vectors gives you. 
# - Emojify-V1 will perform poorly on sentences such as *"This movie is not good and not enjoyable"* because it doesn't understand combinations of words--it just averages all the words' embedding vectors together, without paying attention to the ordering of words. You will build a better algorithm in the next part. 
# 

# ## 2 - Emojifier-V2: Using LSTMs in Keras: 
# 
# Let's build an LSTM model that takes as input word sequences. This model will be able to take word ordering into account. Emojifier-V2 will continue to use pre-trained word embeddings to represent words, but will feed them into an LSTM, whose job it is to predict the most appropriate emoji.

# ### 2.2 Keras and mini-batching 
# 
# In this exercise, we want to train Keras using mini-batches. However, most deep learning frameworks require that all sequences in the same mini-batch have the same length. This is what allows vectorization to work: If you had a 3-word sentence and a 4-word sentence, then the computations needed for them are different (one takes 3 steps of an LSTM, one takes 4 steps) so it's just not possible to do them both at the same time.
# 
# The common solution to this is to use padding. Specifically, set a maximum sequence length, and pad all sequences to the same length. For example, of the maximum sequence length is 20, we could pad every sentence with "0"s so that each input sentence is of length 20. Thus, a sentence "i love you" would be represented as $(e_{i}, e_{love}, e_{you}, \vec{0}, \vec{0}, \ldots, \vec{0})$. In this example, any sentences longer than 20 words would have to be truncated. One simple way to choose the maximum sequence length is to just pick the length of the longest sentence in the training set. 
# 

# ### 2.3 - The Embedding layer
# 
# In Keras, the embedding matrix is represented as a "layer", and maps positive integers (indices corresponding to words) into dense vectors of fixed size (the embedding vectors). It can be trained or initialized with a pretrained embedding. In this part, you will learn how to create an [Embedding()](https://keras.io/layers/embeddings/) layer in Keras, initialize it with the GloVe 50-dimensional vectors loaded earlier in the notebook. Because our training set is quite small, we will not update the word embeddings but will instead leave their values fixed. But in the code below, we'll show you how Keras allows you to either train or leave fixed this layer.  
# 
# The `Embedding()` layer takes an integer matrix of size (batch size, max input length) as input. This corresponds to sentences converted into lists of indices (integers), as shown in the figure below.
# 
# <img src="images/embedding1.png" style="width:700px;height:250px;">
# <caption><center> **Figure 4**: Embedding layer. This example shows the propagation of two examples through the embedding layer. Both have been zero-padded to a length of `max_len=5`. The final dimension of the representation is  `(2,max_len,50)` because the word embeddings we are using are 50 dimensional. </center></caption>
# 
# The largest integer (i.e. word index) in the input should be no larger than the vocabulary size. The layer outputs an array of shape (batch size, max input length, dimension of word vectors).
# 
# The first step is to convert all your training sentences into lists of indices, and then zero-pad all these lists so that their length is the length of the longest sentence. 
# 
# **Exercise**: Implement the function below to convert X (array of sentences as strings) into an array of indices corresponding to words in the sentences. The output shape should be such that it can be given to `Embedding()` (described in Figure 4).
